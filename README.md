# Artificial_Inteligence_programs
AI programs included in this project - README for more information

1. A program that implements an algorithm that generates all n-digit permutations using the recursive method

2. The program that checks which 8-digit permutations are the solution to the 8-hetman problem i.e. check for each permutation 
generated in the task 1 - if it is a solution, display all permutations that are solutions 

3. A program that finds one of the solutions to the problem of 8 hetmans using a recurring search algorithm:
using its simplest version (selecting successive variables and values in ascending order)

4. Minimax algorithm used for Tic-Tac-Toe game. Console game version.
